<p>Narrator: George is going to fly the kite first.</p>
<p>Narrator: George runs as fast as he can. But the kite won’t fly.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: George, you’re doing it all wrong. You didn’t run fast enough. Now it’s my turn.</p>
<p>Narrator: Peppa runs as fast as she can. But the kite still won’t fly.</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: The kite won’t fly if there isn’t any wind, no matter how fast you run.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Oh.</p>
<p>Mummy Pig: We just have to wait until the wind <font color="blue">picks up</font> a bit.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Oh.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Look, <font color="blue">it’s getting windy</font>.</p>
<p>Narrator: Now that it is windy, the kite can fly.</p>
<p>Narrator: The wind is quite strong now.</p>
<p>Narrator: The wind is very strong now.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: George!</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: Peppa!</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Thank you, Daddy.</p>
<p>Narrator: Daddy Pig flies the kite.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Higher, higher.</p>
<p>Narrator: Daddy Pig flies the kite very well.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig and George: Wow!</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: Yes, I am a bit of an expert at these things.</p>
<p>Mummy Pig: Watch out for the trees. You might get the kite <font color="red">stuck in  one.</font></p>
<p>Daddy Pig: Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p>Narrator: Oh dear. Daddy Pig has got the kite caught in a tree.</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: Oh no.</p>
<p>(Daddy Pig is taken a string off the kite)</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: [groaning]</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Oh.</p>
<p>(George Pig is crying)</p>
<p>Mummy Pig: Don’t worry, George. Daddy will get the kite down.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Hurrah!</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: Uh, yes.</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: Careful. There’s a big muddy puddle.</p>
<p>Narrator: Peppa and George love to jump in muddy puddles.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Can we jump in the puddle? Please.</p>
<p>Mummy Pig: No, I don’t want you covered in mud.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Oh.</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: Stand back, children.</p>
<p>Mummy Pig: Please be careful, Daddy Pig.</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: I know what I’m doing.</p>
<p>Mummy Pig: Please be careful.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Just a bit further, Daddy.</p>
<p>Mummy Pig: Daddy Pig, you are much too heavy for that branch.</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: Nonsense. I know exactly how heavy I am. There.</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Hurrah!</p>
<p>Narrator: Daddy Pig has rescued the kite.</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: Whoa!</p>
<p>Narrator: Oh dear. Everyone is covered in mud.</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: It’s only mud.</p>
<p>Narrator: Luckily, Daddy Pig hasn’t hurt himself.</p>
<p>Narrator: And the kite is out of the tree.</p>
<p>Mummy Pig and Peppa Pig: Hurrah!</p>
<p>Peppa Pig: Mummy, now that we’re all muddy, can we jump in the puddle?</p>
<p>Mummy Pig: I suppose so. After all, you can’t get any muddier. And I think Daddy Pig is going to be doing the washing.</p>
<p>Daddy Pig: Oh.</p>
<p>Narrator: Peppa and George love jumping up and down in muddy puddles.</p>
<p>Narrator: Mummy and Daddy love jumping up and down in muddy puddles.</p>
<p>Narrator: Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.</p>
<p>Narrator: Jumping up and down in muddy puddles is just as much fun as flying the kite. </p>
